 # About Me
 I'm a 17 year old guy who likes programming in his freetime. For coding I use nvim/vim and I really enjoy and     
 suffer using it. I mainly write in python and javascript right now. I also have some experience in the
 shell from the overthewire Bandit Level which was really cool and I recommend.
 I also edit videos with Davinci Resolve(coding videos,anime edits,shorts).
