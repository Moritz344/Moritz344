# About Me
I'm a 17 year old who enjoys programming in his free time. 
I switched from vim to Doom Emacs, and I’ve been really enjoying the experience.
Right now, I mainly code in Python and JavaScript. I’ve also gained some shell experience 
through the OverTheWire Bandit challenges, which I found really fun and highly recommend.
In addition to coding, I also have experience in video editing with DaVinci Resolve
.I love building small apps, learning new programming languages, and creating simple games 
inspired by cellular automatons, like Langton's Ant or similar concepts.
